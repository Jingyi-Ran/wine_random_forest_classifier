The dataset are downloaded from https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat508/lesson/analysis-wine-quality-data.
A complete machine learing model is made using random forest classifier and the model is used to predict new (unseen) data. The white wine dataset is used to train, test and build the machine learning model (random forest classifier). The red wine dataset then is used as the new (unseen) data for the model to predict the wine quality.
